# ***bayou*** Workshop tutorial
#### Instructor: Josef C Uyeda (josef.uyeda@gmail.com)

Welcome to the ***bayou*** workshop at the 2017 SSB standalone meeting in Baton Rouge, LA. This workshop is intended to be completed in two 90-minute blocks. ***Before attending the workshop, please make sure you have the needed software and packages installed. Instructions can be found on the course [Wiki](https://github.com/ssb2017/bayou/wiki/workshop_prep).***

The R package ***bayou*** allows to use Bayesian modeling of adaptive trait evolution on phylogenies using Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) models. These models can be used to a test a variety of evolutionary questions regarding the tempo and mode of trait evolution. 

### This workshop will address the following goals:

1. We will learn the theory behind the use of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models in phylogenetic comparative approaches. 

    + Gain an intuitive sense for how OU models work and how they relate to other models
    
    + Understand how the parameters of the model relate to biological processes, and how they are estimated
    
    + Obtain a basic understanding of Bayesian reversible-jump MCMC

2. We will discuss strategies for using ***bayou*** to answer biological questions, and how the approaches implemented in ***bayou*** relate to other implementations of OU models. 

3. Attendees will obtain hands-on experience using ***bayou*** to: 

    + Identify the location and magnitude of adaptive shifts using reversible-jump MCMC
    
    + Diagnose, adjust and tune an MCMC 
    
    + Perform Bayesian model selection in a hypothesis-testing framework 
    
    + Implement customized regression models in an OU modeling framework
